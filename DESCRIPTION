Title: Data Access Object (DAO) framework for R
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2019-010-01
Author: Christoph Nitz
Maintainer: Christoph Nitz <Christoph.Nitz89@gmail.com>
Description: A object-oriented (R6 classes) framework around database actions that provides classes 
    for simple CRUD actions (methods around SQL verbs) ... and many more.
    A data access object (DAO) is an object that provides an abstract interface to 
    some type of database or other persistence mechanism. 
    By mapping application calls to the persistence layer, the DAO provides some specific data operations 
    without exposing details of the database.
